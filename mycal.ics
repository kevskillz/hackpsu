DESCRIPTION:Goal: To get you comfortable with defining and using Python fun
 ctions practicing using variables\, expressions\, and type annotations.\n\
 nRead the instructions carefully before you start the assignment\, and ask
  the course staff for any clarification. Code that does not follow directi
 ons does not receive any credit.\n\nGeneral instructions:\n\n* The work in
  this assignment must be your own original work and be completed alone. Ac
 ademic integrity is expected from all students\, as a reminder\, academic 
 dishonesty involves: \n\n* Searching online for solutions\n\n* Copying co
 de from a previous course or online solution (Except the code provided by 
 the course staff in this Canvas assignment)\n\n* Sharing code: by retyping
  copying\, looking at\, or supplying a file\n\n* Coaching: verbal descript
 ion of code from one person to another\, help a friend to write code line 
 by line\n\n* The instructor and course assistants are available on Teams a
 nd with office hours to answer any questions you may have. \n\n* A few ex
 amples are provided to ensure basic functionality\, however\, they are no 
 representative of the full range of test cases we will be checking. Furthe
 r testing is your responsibility.\n\n* You may submit more than once befor
 e the deadline\; only the latest submission will be graded.\n\n* Your subm
 ission must follow the class coding standards (a set of rules designed to 
 make your code clear and readable). The class coding standards can be revi
 sed under Module 1 on the [📚 Coding Standards] (https://psu.instructure
 .com/courses/2344708/pages/coding-standards) page. \n\n* You are not allo
 wed to use material that has not been covered in class. No credit will be 
 given if you use material that has not been presented in the course materi
 al.\n\n \n\n Assignment-specific instructions:\n\n* Click on this GitHub
  assignment [invitation link] (https://classroom.github.com/a/aOUc-UQB)\, 
 after accepting the assignment\, a private repository is created for you.
  \n\n* Clone the repository inside your CMPSC131 folder by running git cl
 one https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC131/ps-1-<GitHub_username> \n\n* You will
  be writing several functions\, but they will all be saved in one file:  
 PS1.py.  Please save all the functions in this one file or you will lose 
 points.\n\n* Each question has different requirements\, read them carefull
 y and ask questions if you need clarification. \n\n* Commit and push your
  code to your repository as you make significant changes to your file\n\n*
  If you need to share your code with the course staff for questions and fe
 edback\, send your GitHub username and the 7-character commit ID we should
  check (typically the last one)  \n\n* 🚨 If you require an extension 
 for this upcoming assignment\, remember to submit an extension request in 
 accordance with our [extension policy] (https://psu.instructure.com/course
 s/2344708/assignments/syllabus#extension_policy) [Send Request] (https://
 forms.office.com/r/BagpmSPS4i)\n\n \n\nOrientation Session\n\nPhil\, our 
 Learning Assistant\, guides you through the outline of selected homework p
 roblems. \n\nSubmission format:\n\n* Submit your PS1.py file to the Probl
 em Set #1 Gradescope assignment before the due date.\n\n \n\nGrading Note
 s:\n\n* Post-Due Date Testing (50%): For this assignment\, you may assume 
 that all the input you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, if the inpu
 t is a whole number\, we will test with integers). If an incorrect type is
  provided\, and the program raises a TypeError or ValueError\, then that i
 s okay for now. If the types provided as arguments are correct\, however\,
  the function should not throw one of these errors. Additionally\, it is i
 mportant that the function works correctly over all valid values.\n\n* Des
 ign and Clarity (50%): To evaluate code clarity and design that displays a
 n understanding of class concepts we will use the following evaluation cri
 teria:\n\n* Code Readability (15%):\n\n* Includes information required in 
 the template file header (name\, GitHub username and collaboration stateme
 nt)\n\n* Type annotations in each function definition (parameters and retu
 rn type). \n\n* Docstring documenting each of the functions you write tha
 t includes a brief description of what the function does\, arguments\, dis
 played information (if any)\, and return values. \n\n* Descriptive variab
 le names according to our course standards \n\n* Example: Write a functio
 n named addition that takes two numbers\, adds them together\, and returns
  the result as a float. Before returning the result the function must prin
 t a message reporting the result of the operation\n\n"""\n\nCourse: CMPSC1

  Evidence of Additional Testing (5%): Put at least three tests for each f
 unction in the main function that differ from any examples provided in the
  instructions.\n\n* Design (30%): Performs required operations correctly\,
  returns/prints values with appropriate syntax\n\n \n\nGeneral Grading Ru
 bric for All Programming Assignments\n\nPenalty\n\nReason\n\n-100%\n\nProg
 ram does not run due to syntax errors (missing colons\, indentation errors
 \, etc) or module errors (unsupported library imports) will not be graded 
 at all\n\n-100%\n\nUsing concepts which you were specifically told not to 
 use\n\n-100%\n\nUse break or continue statements in loops when told not to
  use them(while these statements are useful to provide multiple exit point
 s in loops\, they are highly abused when starting to program instead of de
 fining a meaningful continuation condition. None of the problems in this c
 ourse involve complex exit points\, hence\, their use is prohibited in all
  components of this course)\n\n-100%\n\nCode that uses content not covered
  in class\n\n-100%\n\nFailing to submit the proper file.\n\nUp to -99%\n\n
 Program does run without runtime errors. If a program does not run it cann
 ot be given a grade.\n\nUp to -50%\n\nOutput of your program does not matc
 h the expected output.\n\nUp to -70%\n\nProgram does not follow specificat
 ions. The projects are designed to help you practice and learn various con
 cepts. When these concepts are not implemented as specified\, we cannot de
 termine if you know how to use these concepts.\n\nUp to -70%\n\nIncomplete
  or inadequate comments/documentation. This includes using profanity in co
 de comments or variable names\n\nUp to -50%\n\nUsing non-descriptive or no
 n-professional identifiers. \n\nUp to -10%\n\nIncorrect code formatting. 
 While formatting is not important to the Python interpreter\, it does make
  the code easier to read and follow. The importance of formatting grows as
  the complexity of the programs increase.

DESCRIPTION:Students must submit 10 out of 12 possible weekly portfolio e
 ntries by the end of the semester. These are due weekly. If you do 11 entr
 ies\, your lowest score will be dropped.\n\nPortfolio Entry Specifics:\n\n
 * For each weekly entry\, students should\, at minimum\, identify and elab
 orate on:\n\n* (1) something new to you in the readings\;\n\n* (2) a conce
 pt or idea of interest presented in the readings\;\n\n* (3) a connection b
 etween the week’s readings or\, increasingly\, between the week's readin
 gs and one or more readings from prior weeks.\n\n* Each of the 3 points sh
 ould be elaborated upon with\, at minimum\, a paragraph’s discussion in 
 which the student demonstrates her/his/their understanding of the subject 
 and\, increasingly\, connects it to other concepts\, theories\, or practic
 es discussed elsewhere in the material. These discussions are intended to
  be analytical. If you include personal reflections\, it must be in servi
 ce of a larger point you seek to make.\n\n* Remember: Think about what the
  aspects of Hinduism that you discuss can tell us about the nature of Hind
 uism or the value that Hindus place on this or that. For example\, what mi
 ght a feature of a particular deity or myth tell us about how Hindus conce
 ptualize the nature of the divine or the relationship between humans and d
 eities or how it all might inform how people live their lives on a daily b
 asis or value as an ideal--and why?\n\n* Your entry/discussion must refere
 nce each of the week’s readings.\n\n* To earn full credit\, at least 2 
 of the 3 points must draw explicitly on (i.e.\, quote or paraphrase and ci
 te) one or more of the week’s readings in a meaningful way. That is\, 
 to simply quote an author’s definition of a term\, for example\, is insu
 fficient.\n\n* When citing your source\, please use the following format: 
 (Author last name\, page number) at the end of the sentence citing their w
 ork or in a footnote. Example: (Baltutis\, 3). You do not need a bibliogra
 phy or works cited page.\n\n* Minimum word count is 450 words. Maximum is 
 800 words.\n\n* Include your name\, date\, our course info\, and portfolio
  # at the top of your submission.

 r planning work by answering the following questions.  Post your answers 
 in this forum:\n\n* Describe how you interact with the problem or issue on
  which you'll be taking a stance. Perhaps tell a personal story. How does 
 this problem or issue affect you?\n\n* Think about who needs to accept you
 r point of view\, or at least understand that your position is a valid and
  acceptable point of view.  This will be your audience. \n\n* Describe h
 ow your audience interacts with this problem or issue. How does it affect 
 your audience in a slightly different or similar way?\n\n* Think about wha
 t kind of rhetorical appeal—ethos\, pathos\, logos—might move your aud
 ience to accept your point of view. Using the appeal that might resonate b
 est with your audience\, tell them why they should accept your point of vi
 ew.\n\n* Craft a thesis statement. This is your central claim—your posit
 ion. Think of your best reason for your position. It might be helpful if y
 ou use this skeleton for your thesis statement: "(Position) because (good 
 reason)."\n\nAfter you have answered all the questions\, compose a draft o
 f an introduction paragraph for your Assignment 2 essay.  Submit that par
 agraph in this forum. \n\n------------------------------------\nPart Two:

 ductions are intended to provide the audience with the necessary context t
 hey need in order to accept an argument. Thinking as the writer's audience
 --which should be obvious from their writing—offer feedback on a classma
 te's introduction using these prompts:\n\n* In your own words\, restate th
 e writer's position.  Does it seem attractive to the audience?\n\n* Indi
 cate the ways the  writer made the position attractive to the audience.\n
 \n* List some ways the writer can make the position more attractive to the
  audience.\n\n* Suggest one way that the writer can make their issue or po
 sition more narrow.\n\n* Suggest one concrete way the introduction can be 
 more specific (and\, therefore\, less general).\n\n* Suggest one concrete 
 way in which the thesis statement can be more complex.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:So far\, you've analyzed the rhetorical practices of other rhet
 ors in your rhetorical analysis unit.  In this discussion\, you're going 
 to build on that knowledge by crafting your own rhetoric in a position arg
 ument. \n\n-------------------------\nYour Post (Due Wednesday)\n--------
 -----------------\n\nTake 10 minutes to write about something you believe 
 in strongly.  First\, you might describe how you came to this belief and 
 list reasons that support your belief.  Next\, consider who might disagre
 e with your belief and why they might do so.  Finally\, how might you bes
 t communicate your belief to an audience that doesn't share that belief? 
 \n\n---------------------------------\nDiscussion Responses (Due Sunday)\n
 ---------------------------------\n\nRead your classmates' posts and choos
 e one to respond to.   Help them develop their position by 1) identifyin
 g specific examples to support their reasons for their belief\; 2) politel
 y offering reasons that contradict their belief\; and/or 3) helping them b
 etter understand the people who might disagree with them. \n\n

DESCRIPTION:*\n\nToday you will work on a series of exercises related to fu
 nctions and conditionals. You will answer some "What would Python display?
 " questions based on control flow and create a few Python programs from sc
 ratch.\n\n*\n\nFor starters\, be sure to have a Python development environ
 ment available for use\n\n*\n\nIf you are working from your personal devic
 e\, open VS Code and create and save a new Python file\n\n*\n\nIf you are 
 working on the Lab Desktops\, in the Search box (next Start icon in the lo
 wer left corner) type python and click on the App "Python 3.X (32/64)-bi
 t" or "Anaconda Python" or "Spyder"\n\n*\n\nYou may collaborate with one o
 ther student in your recitation section\, and feel free to ask the TAs for
  assistance at any time. You should always do your best to finish the acti
 vity during recitation hours\, however\, we also provide credit for effort
 .\n\n*\n\nIMPORTANT: To receive credit for your recitation activity\, you
  must go with your TAs to get your attendance grade. If you leave the room
  without the TA marking your attendance\, you will receive a zero for this
  week’s recitation.  Make sure you have been given a grade for attendan
 ce before you leave! \n\nSample Solution to coding problems: \n\n#Condit

DESCRIPTION:Goal: Apply conditional statements for making decisions within 
 a program by using if\, else\, and elif statements to control the flow of 
 your code based on different conditions.\n\nRead the instructions carefull
 y before you start the assignment\, and ask the course staff for any clari
 fication. Code that does not follow directions does not receive any credit
 .\n\nGeneral instructions:\n\n* The work in this assignment must be your o
 wn original work and be completed alone. Academic integrity is expected fr
 om all students\, as a reminder\, academic dishonesty involves: \n\n* Sea
 rching online for solutions\n\n* Copying code from a previous course or on
 line solution (Except the code provided by the course staff in this Canvas
  assignment)\n\n* Sharing code: by retyping copying\, looking at\, or supp
 lying a file\n\n* Coaching: verbal description of code from one person to 
 another\, help a friend to write code line by line\n\n* The instructor and
  course assistants are available on Teams and with office hours to answer 
 any questions you may have. \n\n* A few examples are provided to ensure b
 asic functionality\, however\, they are no representative of the full rang
 e of test cases we will be checking. Further testing is your responsibilit
 y.\n\n* You may submit more than once before the deadline\; only the lates
 t submission will be graded.\n\n* Your submission must follow the class co
 ding standards (a set of rules designed to make your code clear and readab
 le). The class coding standards can be revised under Module 1 on the [📚
  Coding Standards] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2344708/pages/codi
 ng-standards) page. \n\n* You are not allowed to use material that has no
 t been covered in class. No credit will be given if you use material that 
 has not been presented in the course material.\n\n \n\n Assignment-speci
 fic instructions:\n\n* Click on this GitHub assignment [invitation link] (
 https://classroom.github.com/a/9dCRgAM7)\, after accepting the assignment\
 , a private repository is created for you. \n\n* Clone the repository ins
 ide your CMPSC131 folder by running git clone https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC
 131/ps2-<GitHub_username> \n\n* You will be writing several functions\, b
 ut they will all be saved in one file:  PS2.py.  Please save all the fun
 ctions in this one file or you will lose points.\n\n* Each question has di
 fferent requirements\, read them carefully and ask questions if you need c
 larification. \n\n* Commit and push your code to your repository as you m
 ake significant changes to your file\n\n* If you need to share your code w
 ith the course staff for questions and feedback\, send your GitHub usernam
 e and the 7-character commit ID we should check (typically the last one) 
  \n\n* 🚨 If you require an extension for this upcoming assignment\, re
 member to submit an extension request in accordance with our [extension po
 licy] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2344708/assignments/syllabus#ex
 tension_policy) [Send Request] (https://forms.office.com/r/g7fu57mbT4)\n\
 n \n\nOrientation Session\n\nPhil\, our Learning Assistant\, guides you t
 hrough the outline of selected homework problems. \n\nSubmission format:\
 n\n* Submit your PS2.py file to the Problem Set #2 Gradescope assignment b
 efore the due date.\n\n \n\nGrading Notes:\n\n* Post-Due Date Testing (50
 %): When a function accepts arguments\, the valid data types and (if relev
 ant) value ranges for these arguments are specified in the problem\, you m
 ay assume that all the input you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, i
 f the input is a whole number\, we will test with integers). Some problems
  will also state what to do if an argument violates its value range (for e
 xample\, if an argument must fall between 0 and 1\, but 15 is used)\, if t
 hat information is provided\, your implementation must handle invalid inpu
 ts accordingly. \n\n* Design and Clarity (50%): To evaluate code clarity 
 and design that displays an understanding of class concepts we will use th
 e following evaluation criteria:\n\n* Code Readability (15%):\n\n* Include
 s information required in the template file header (name\, GitHub username
  and collaboration statement)\n\n* Type annotations in each function defin
 ition (parameters and return type). \n\n* Docstring documenting each of t
 he functions you write that includes a brief description of what the funct
 ion does\, arguments\, displayed information (if any)\, and return values.
  \n\n* Descriptive variable names according to our course standards \n\n
 * Example: Write a function named addition that takes two numbers\, adds t
 hem together\, and returns the result as a float. Before returning the res
 ult the function must print a message reporting the result of the operatio

 n \n\nGeneral Grading Rubric for All Programming Assignments\n\nPenalty\n
 \nReason\n\n-100%\n\nProgram does not run due to syntax errors (missing co
 lons\, indentation errors\, etc) or module errors (unsupported library imp
 orts) will not be graded at all\n\n-100%\n\nUsing concepts which you were 
 specifically told not to use\n\n-100%\n\nUse break or continue statements 
 in loops when told not to use them(while these statements are useful to pr
 ovide multiple exit points in loops\, they are highly abused when starting
  to program instead of defining a meaningful continuation condition. None 
 of the problems in this course involve complex exit points\, hence\, their
  use is prohibited in all components of this course)\n\n-100%\n\nCode that
  uses content not covered in class\n\n-100%\n\nFailing to submit the prope
 r file.\n\nUp to -99%\n\nProgram does run without runtime errors. If a pro
 gram does not run it cannot be given a grade.\n\nUp to -50%\n\nOutput of y
 our program does not match the expected output.\n\nUp to -70%\n\nProgram d
 oes not follow specifications. The projects are designed to help you pract
 ice and learn various concepts. When these concepts are not implemented as
  specified\, we cannot determine if you know how to use these concepts.\n\
 nUp to -70%\n\nIncomplete or inadequate comments/documentation. This inclu
 des using profanity in code comments or variable names\n\nUp to -50%\n\nUs
 ing non-descriptive or non-professional identifiers. \n\nUp to -10%\n\nIn
 correct code formatting. While formatting is not important to the Python i
 nterpreter\, it does make the code easier to read and follow. The importan
 ce of formatting grows as the complexity of the programs increase.

 "font-size: 14pt\;"><em>Post-Due Date Testing (50%)</em>: When a function 
 accepts arguments\, the valid data types and (if relevant) value ranges fo
 r these arguments are specified in the problem\, you may assume that all t
 he input you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, if the input is a who
 le number\, we will test with integers). Some problems will also state wha
 t to do if an argument violates its value range (for example\, if an argum
 ent must fall between 0 and 1\, but 15 is used)\, if that information is p
 rovided\, your implementation must handle invalid inputs accordingly.&nbsp
 \;</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 14pt\;"><em>Design and Clarity
  (50%)</em>: To evaluate code clarity and design that displays an understa
 nding of class concepts we will use the following evaluation criteria:</sp

 s in each function definition (parameters and return type).&nbsp\;</span><
 /li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 14pt\;">Docstring documenting each of th

DESCRIPTION:Students must submit 10 out of 12 possible weekly portfolio e
 ntries by the end of the semester. These are due weekly. If you do 11 entr
 ies\, your lowest score will be dropped.\n\nPortfolio Entry Specifics:\n\n
 * For each weekly entry\, students should\, at minimum\, identify and elab
 orate on:\n\n* (1) something new to you in the readings\;\n\n* (2) a conce
 pt or idea of interest presented in the readings\;\n\n* (3) a connection b
 etween the week’s readings or\, increasingly\, between the week's readin
 gs and one or more readings from prior weeks.\n\n* Student do not need to 
 write "Something that was new to me is..." or " I found X interesting beca
 use..." Just start writing about the ideas\, concepts\, and connections yo
 u are seeing\, digesting\, and processing and explain them. These are anal
 ytical responses to the readings so you want to demonstrate that you under
 stand the ideas\, concepts\, and connections and therefore must explain th
 em.\n\n* Each of the 3 points should be elaborated upon with\, at minimum\
 , a paragraph’s discussion in which the student demonstrates her/his/the
 ir understanding of the subject and\, increasingly\, connects it to other 
 concepts\, theories\, or practices discussed elsewhere in the material. T
 hese discussions are intended to be analytical. If you include personal r
 eflections\, it must be in service of a larger point you seek to make.\n\n
 * Remember: Think about what the aspects of Hinduism that you discuss can 
 tell us about the nature of Hinduism or the value that Hindus place on
  this or that. For example\, what might a feature of a particular deity or
  myth tell us about how Hindus conceptualize the nature of the divine or t
 he relationship between humans and deities or how it all might inform how 
 people live their lives on a daily basis or value as an ideal--and why?\n\
 n* Your entry/discussion must reference each of the week’s readings.\n\n
 * To earn full credit\, at least 2 of the 3 points must draw explicitly o
 n (i.e.\, quote or paraphrase and cite) one or more of the week’s readin
 gs in a meaningful way. That is\, to simply quote an author’s definiti
 on of a term\, for example\, is insufficient.\n\n* When citing your source
 \, please use the following format: (Author last name\, page number) at th
 e end of the sentence citing their work or in a footnote. Example: (Baltut
 is\, 3). You do not need a bibliography or works cited page.\n\n* Minimum 
 word count is 450 words. Maximum is 800 words.\n\n* Include your name\, da
 te\, our course info\, and portfolio # at the top of your submission.

DESCRIPTION:Discussion Forum #2_Rama\, Ayodhya\, Vishnu's avatars\n\nThere 
 are 5 discussion forums over the course of the semester. DF#3 is required 
 for everyone. You must do 3 other ones for a total of 4 discussion forums.
  Each is due the week it is assigned. No extensions.\n\nFor this discussio
 n forum:\n\n1. Identify one of these topics to focus on: Rama/Ramayana/a
  Vishnu avatar OR Ayodhya OR caste discrimination (in India or US). (If
  you previously did a post on Rama or Hanuman\, you must choose something 
 different. There are a lot of interesting characters in the epic and the h
 istory and contemporary controversy around Ayodhya is too!)\n\n2a. If you 
 choose to focus on Rama or another character from the Ramayana or one of V
 ishnu's avatars\, identify the following information about him/her\, ident
 ify what is important about the character\, imagery associated with them\,
  status in popular culture\, etc. \n\nOR\n\n2b. If you choose to focus on
  Ayodhya or caste discrimination\, find a news article from the last 5 
 years that addresses either topic in some capacity. These are hot issues 
 in recent years so there should be plenty of good articles and debates. So
 me reliable sources include: New York Times\, NPR\, The Hindu\, Economic a
 nd Political Weekly\, the Caravan\, Feminist Issues in India.\n\n3a. Prepa
 re a 200-400 words post that introduces your topic to the class. Your p
 ost must be more than a summary of their role in the Ramayana for full cre
 dit. For example\, think about how their story is received or challenged.
  \n\nOR \n\n3b. Write a 200-400 word summary of the article you found th
 at includes a statement about why you find your article compelling\, how i
 t connects to our reading\, and why it might help us to better understand 
 Hinduism. \n\n4. Include citations for any sources accessed. This initia
 l post is due end of day\, Wednesday\, Sept 25.\n\n5. Read your classmate
 s' posts and comment on at least 2 of them. What connections can you ma
 ke or how can you triangulate our class readings\, your post\, and their p
 osts? What new perspective(s) did you gain? Responses are due by end of d
 ay\, Sunday\, Sept 29.\n\nThese discussion forums are worth 25 points each
 . There are 4 discussion forums over the course of the semester (for 100 p
 oints total).\n\nGrading:\n\n15 points = initial post (15 = check plus\, 1
 3 = check\, 11 = check minus\, 10 = turned in something\, 0 = turned in no
 thing)\n\n10 points = 5 points/comment x 2 comments (5 = invested comment\

DESCRIPTION:Goal: Apply loop statements to repeat code within a program by 
 using for and while statements.\n\nRead the instructions carefully before 
 you start the assignment\, and ask the course staff for any clarification.
  Code that does not follow directions does not receive any credit.\n\nGene
 ral instructions:\n\n* The work in this assignment must be your own origin
 al work and be completed alone. Academic integrity is expected from all st
 udents\, as a reminder\, academic dishonesty involves: \n\n* Searching on
 line for solutions\n\n* Copying code from a previous course or online solu
 tion (Except the code provided by the course staff in this Canvas assignme
 nt)\n\n* Sharing code: by retyping copying\, looking at\, or supplying a f
 ile\n\n* Coaching: verbal description of code from one person to another\,
  help a friend to write code line by line\n\n* The instructor and course a
 ssistants are available on Teams and with office hours to answer any quest
 ions you may have. \n\n* A few examples are provided to ensure basic func
 tionality\, however\, they are no representative of the full range of test
  cases we will be checking. Further testing is your responsibility.\n\n* Y
 ou may submit more than once before the deadline\; only the latest submiss
 ion will be graded.\n\n* Your submission must follow the class coding stan
 dards (a set of rules designed to make your code clear and readable). The 
 class coding standards can be revised under Module 1 on the [📚 Coding S
 tandards] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2344708/pages/coding-standa
 rds) page. \n\n* You are not allowed to use material that has not been co
 vered in class. No credit will be given if you use material that has not b
 een presented in the course material.\n\n \n\n Assignment-specific instr
 uctions:\n\n* Click on this GitHub assignment [invitation link] (https://c
 lassroom.github.com/a/HHnr6Xvw)\, after accepting the assignment\, a priva
 te repository is created for you. \n\n* Clone the repository inside your 
 CMPSC131 folder by running git clone https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC131/ps3-<
 GitHub_username> \n\n* You will be writing several functions\, but they w
 ill all be saved in one file:  PS3.py.  Please save all the functions in
  this one file or you will lose points.\n\n* Each question has different r
 equirements\, read them carefully and ask questions if you need clarificat
 ion. \n\n* Commit and push your code to your repository as you make signi
 ficant changes to your file\n\n* If you need to share your code with the c
 ourse staff for questions and feedback\, send your GitHub username and the
  7-character commit ID we should check (typically the last one)  \n\n* 
 🚨 If you require an extension for this upcoming assignment\, remember t

 rientation Session\n\nPhil\, our Learning Assistant\, guides you through t
 he outline of selected homework problems. \n\n \n\nSubmission format:\n\
 n* Submit your PS3.py file to the Problem Set #3 Gradescope assignment bef
 ore the due date.\n\n \n\nGrading Notes:\n\n* Post-Due Date Testing (50%)
 : When a function accepts arguments\, the valid data types and (if relevan
 t) value ranges for these arguments are specified in the problem\, you may
  assume that all the input you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, if 
 the input is a whole number\, we will test with integers). Some problems w
 ill also state what to do if an argument violates its value range (for exa
 mple\, if an argument must fall between 0 and 1\, but 15 is used)\, if tha
 t information is provided\, your implementation must handle invalid inputs

 d design that displays an understanding of class concepts we will use the 
 following evaluation criteria:\n\n* Code Readability (15%):\n\n* Includes 
 information required in the template file header (name\, GitHub username a
 nd collaboration statement)\n\n* Type annotations in each function definit
 ion (parameters and return type). \n\n* Docstring documenting each of the
  functions you write that includes a brief description of what the functio
 n does\, arguments\, displayed information (if any)\, and return values. 
 \n\n* Descriptive variable names according to our course standards \n\n* 
 Example: Write a function named addition that takes two numbers\, adds the
 m together\, and returns the result as a float. Before returning the resul
 t the function must print a message reporting the result of the operation\

 for these arguments are specified in the problem\, you may assume that all
  the input you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, if the input is a w
 hole number\, we will test with integers). Some problems will also state w
 hat to do if an argument violates its value range (for example\, if an arg
 ument must fall between 0 and 1\, but 15 is used)\, if that information is
  provided\, your implementation must handle invalid inputs accordingly.&nb

DESCRIPTION:Students must submit 10 out of 12 possible weekly portfolio e
 ntries by the end of the semester. These are due weekly. If you do 11 entr
 ies\, your lowest score will be dropped.\n\nPortfolio Entry Specifics:\n\n
 * For this weekly entry\, students should identify and elaborate on:\n\n* 
 1-2 important concepts discussed in the readings\n\n* 1-2 connections betw
 een the week’s readings or\, increasingly\, between the week's readings 
 and one or more readings from prior weeks.\n\n* You must make at least 3 d
 istinct points. These can (and likely will be) (inter)related. For example
 \, you could choose to focus on a prominent theme from the week\, such as 
 dharma\, and then explore that theme from three different angles and sets 
 of examples. You can also identify topics that are not immediately related
  (but I encourage you to think harder about whether there might actually b
 e some interesting connections!).\n\n* Read this excellent\, succinct summ
 ary of the "[6 pieces of a paragraph] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses
 /2339634/files/167902688?wrap=1)."\n\n* Students are encouraged to prepare
  this critical analytical reading response in a traditional 5-paragraph pa
 per format\, but you can continue to prepare it as three separate topics a
 s well. Either way\, students must demonstrate her/his/their understanding
  of the subject and connect it to other concepts\, theories\, or practices
  discussed elsewhere in the material. These discussions are intended to b
 e analytical. If you include personal reflections\, it must be in service
  of a larger point you seek to make.\n\n* Remember: Think about what the a
 spects of Hinduism that you discuss can tell us about the nature of Hind
 uism or the value that Hindus place on this or that. For example\, what 
 might a feature of a particular deity or myth tell us about how Hindus con
 ceptualize the nature of the divine or the relationship between humans and
  deities or how it all might inform how people live their lives on a daily
  basis or value as an ideal--and why?\n\n* Your entry/discussion must refe
 rence each of the week’s readings.\n\n* To earn full credit\, at least 
 2 of the 3 points must draw explicitly on (i.e.\, quote or paraphrase and 
 cite) one or more of the week’s readings in a meaningful way. That is\
 , to simply quote an author’s definition of a term\, for example\, is in
 sufficient.\n\n* When citing your source\, please use the following format
 : (Author last name\, page number) at the end of the sentence citing their
  work or in a footnote. Example: (Baltutis\, 3). You do not need a bibliog
 raphy or works cited page.\n\n* Minimum word count is 500 words. Maximum i
 s 800 words.\n\n* Include your name\, date\, our course info\, and portfol
 io # at the top of your submission.

 n\nAn important step in drafting is peer feedback. Pick two student peers
  who have posted a rough draft on this Peer Review workshop's discussion 
 board. (Scroll down below to find the discussion board. Try to select peer
 s who have not been peer reviewed already.) You will carefully read an

 both partners' essays by Sunday night.\n\nBe as specific as possible with 
 your comments and questions. For more information on how to peer review\,
  see [Commentary: What is Peer Review?] (https://psu.instructure.com/cours
 es/2357247/pages/commentary-what-is-peer-review)\n\nUse the following prom
 pts to guide your peer review: \n\n* Comment on the audience and purpose.
  To what opportunity for change is the writer responding? Who might be the
  rhetorical audience? What might be the writer's purpose?\n\n* Comment on
  the introduction of the essay. How and why might the introduction of the 
 draft essay engage members of the intended audience? What else could be do
 ne to speak specifically to that audience? What seems missing? In what way
  could the material in the introduction better transition to the thesis st
 atement?\n\n* Comment on the clarity of the thesis statement and whether i
 t is appropriately qualified.  \n\n* Note the assertions the writer make
 s to support the thesis.  Are they presented in chronological\, spatial o
 r emphatic order? How might you reorder the assertions for overall effecti
 veness?\n\n* Point out any paragraphs where the writing or the evidence co
 uld be improved by using a rhetorical method of development.\n\n* Point ou
 t any specific claims or uses of evidence in the draft that you find confu
 sing or problematic. \n\n* Determine if the writer fairly represents alte
 rnative perspectives\, using some of the strategies in the Rogerian or Tou
 lmin style to invite rather than condemn opposing views. Where does the wr
 iter accept the validity of another point? Might doing so strengthen the w
 riter's credibility? \n\n* Describe the tone of the position argument.  
 Identify key words or phrases that suggest this tone. Do you find the tone
  to be effective\, given the issue and the writer’s position? Why or why
  not? What adjustments in tone—if any—would you suggest?\n\n* Comment 
 on the overall effectiveness. What section of the argument did you most en
 joy? Why?

 about a lot more than the Gita! You will want to be sure to address some o
 f the key points discussed and read for Tuesday's class. You may also want
  to identify a passage from the Gita to do a close reading of its meaning-
 -but be sure to draw on and put the verse in conversation with key points 
 from the book that help draw out central concepts\; that is\, do not rely 
 solely on your own personal interpretation.\n\n* For this weekly entry\, s
 tudents should identify and elaborate on:\n\n* 1-2 important concepts disc
 ussed in the readings\n\n* What is Hinduism\, chapter 4 and Bhagavad-gita\
 , chapters 1-6\n\n* 1-2 connections between the week’s readings or\, inc
 reasingly\, between the week's readings and one or more readings from prio
 r weeks.\n\n* You must make at least 3 distinct points. These can (and lik
 ely will be) (inter)related. For example\, you could choose to focus on a 
 prominent theme from the week\, such as dharma\, and then explore that the
 me from three different angles and sets of examples. You can also identify
  topics that are not immediately related (but I encourage you to think har
 der about whether there might actually be some interesting connections!).\
 n\n* Read this excellent\, succinct summary of the "[6 pieces of a paragra
 ph] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2339634/files/167902688?wrap=1)[
  Download 6 pieces of a paragraph] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2
 339634/files/167902688/download)."\n\n* Students are encouraged to prepare
  this critical analytical reading response in a traditional 5-paragraph pa
 per format\, but you can continue to prepare it as three separate topics a
 s well. Either way\, students must demonstrate her/his/their understanding
  of the subject and connect it to other concepts\, theories\, or practices
  discussed elsewhere in the material. These discussions are intended to b
 e analytical. If you include personal reflections\, it must be in service
  of a larger point you seek to make.\n\n* Remember: Think about what the a
 spects of Hinduism that you discuss can tell us about the nature of Hind
 uism or the value that Hindus place on this or that. For example\, what 
 might a feature of a particular deity or myth tell us about how Hindus con
 ceptualize the nature of the divine or the relationship between humans and
  deities or how it all might inform how people live their lives on a daily
  basis or value as an ideal--and why?\n\n* Your entry/discussion must refe
 rence each of the week’s readings to earn full credit. More specifically
 \, to earn full credit\, at least 2 of the 3 points must draw explicitly 
 on (i.e.\, quote or paraphrase and cite) one or more of the week’s readi
 ngs in a meaningful way. That is\, to simply quote an author’s definit
 ion of a term\, for example\, is insufficient.\n\n* When citing your sourc
 e\, please use the following format: (Author last name\, page number) at t
 he end of the sentence citing their work or in a footnote. Example: (Baltu
 tis\, 3). You do not need a bibliography or works cited page.\n\n* Minimum
  word count is 600 words. (Approximate 200 words per point at minimum.) Ma
 ximum is 1000 words.\n\n* Include your name\, date\, our course info\, and
  portfolio # at the top of your submission.

DESCRIPTION:-------------------------------\nPart One: Revising Assignment 
 2\n-------------------------------\n\nFor this workshop\, you will work th
 rough the following activities on your own draft.  Then you will post you
 r plan for revision in this forum\, which will address what you've learned
  from each activity. \n\nUsing your own draft of Assignment 2:\n\n* Exami
 ne your thesis statement. Can it be revised for greater precision and spec
 ificity? Practice rewriting your thesis statement in a number of ways: wit
 h fewer words\, in two or three sentences\, as a question\, etc.  Which v
 ersion of the thesis do you prefer?  \n\n* Examine the topic sentences f
 rom your body paragraphs. Each topic sentence should answer the question "
 What is the main point of this paragraph?" Topic sentences should not simp
 ly state a topic but actually tell readers what point you are making about
  that topic.  Practice rewriting your topic sentences. \n\n* Examine the
  body paragraphs of your draft.  If the paragraph has more than one main 
 point\, or if you notice that a paragraph shifts to a new topic halfway th
 rough\, that is a sign that you should start a new paragraph with a new to
 pic sentence. Revise your draft to improve paragraphs accordingly.  [Com
 mentary: Paragraphs and Topic Sentences] (https://psu.instructure.com/cour
 ses/2357247/pages/commentary-paragraphs-and-topic-sentences) discusses som
 e strategies for writing and organizing paragraphs with clarity and variat
 ion. \n\n* Examine your essay for places where you can increase the effec
 tiveness and impact of your sentences and word choices.  Where can you ad
 d variety to your sentence structures?  Does your writing read with a ple
 asing rhythm? Where can you add parallelism? Write a sentence that uses pa
 rallelism to add variety and interest. Include this sentence in your revis
 ion. (See Chapter 16 in The New Harbrace Guide.)\n\n* Examine your use of 
 logic and reasoning in your essay.  Does your essay include any logical f
 allacies? Be sure to qualify and substantiate your claims to avoid logical
  fallacies. (See pages 138-140 in The New Harbrace Guide.)\n\nAfter workin
 g through the above activities on your own\, post your plan for revising y
 our essay.  This plan should include the following information:\n\n* a br
 ief summary of the information you received from your peer review and how 
 it might affect your revision\;\n\n* an analysis of your thesis statement\
 , including an example of a revised thesis statement\;\n\n* an analysis of
  your topic sentences and paragraphs\, mentioning any that you plan to rev
 ise\;\n\n* an analysis of your use of logic and reasoning\;\n\n* any other
  plans you have for revising your essay\;\n\n* an example of a "before and
  after" paragraph.  Copy a paragraph that you plan to revise here\, then 
 also post the revision. \n\n-------------------------------\nThere is no

DESCRIPTION:Before you start:\n\n* Submit your implementations only in a fi
 le named ECW.py to the Extra Credit for Worksheets Gradescope Assignment.
  \n\n* Failure to follow these requirements will result in an zero score 
 for the assignment even if the autograder gives you full score.\n\n* Code 
 submitted with syntax errors does not receive ANY credit\n\n* Points Avail
 able: 20\n\n \n\nProblem 1. Twinning (10 pts)\n\nPenn State's email ids a
 re strings with 3 initials\, followed by an arbitrary number of digits. We
  will not worry about case for email ids\, so 'bzr2'\, 'BZR2' and 'Bzr2' a
 re all the same. Two psu email ids are called twins if they have the same 
 initials\, and their numbers only differ by one\, so 'bzr2' and 'bzr3' are
  twins\, as are 'GXC209' and 'gxc210'. Write the Python code to implement 
 the function are_twins(psuid1\, psuid2) where both parameters are non-em
 pty strings. The function returns True if psuid1 and psuid2 are twins
 \, False otherwise. Implement the function without using loops\, use only
  slicing. You are not allowed to use built-in methods to transform a strin
 g to all lowercase or uppercase\, instead\, you must define your own helpe
 r functions. This was done in Module 5 lectures. This helper method is the
  only one where a loop is allowed to visit each character in the string.\n
 \nExamples:\n\n>>> are_twins('mjp75'\, 'Mjp76')\nTrue\n>>> are_twins('brw1
 '\, 'brw2')   \nTrue\n>>> are_twins('tyw589'\, 'TYw590') \nTrue\n>>> ar
 e_twins('tyw589'\, 'TYw587')  \nFalse\n>>> are_twins('tyw589'\, 'gxc590')
  \nFalse\n\n \n\nProblem 2. Destructive sum (10 pts)\n\nWrite the Python
  code to implement the function sum_fold(lst) where lst is a list of n
 umbers. The function mutates the provided list to contain the accumulate
 d sum as follows: Each element at position i becomes the sum up to and 
 including that position. You should not create new lists or return any val
 ue at all (so\, implicitly\, it should return None).\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> m
 y_list = [0\,1\,2\,3\,4]\n>>> sum_fold(my_list) \n>>> my_list        
   \n[0\, 1\, 3\, 6\, 10]\n>>> my_list = [5\,2\,-9\,6]  \n>>> sum_fold(my

DESCRIPTION:Before you start:\n\n* Submit your implementations only in a fi
 le named ECP.py to the Extra Credit for Problem Sets Gradescope Assignment
 . \n\n* Failure to follow these requirements will result in an zero score
  for the assignment even if the autograder gives you full score.\n\n* Code
  submitted with syntax errors does not receive ANY credit\n\n* Points Avai
 lable: 60\n\n \n\nProblem 1. Title Case (10 pts)\n\nWrite the Python code
  to implement the function title_case(s) where s is a string. The func
 tion returns a new string where the first letter of each word is capitali
 zed\, and the rest of the letters in the word are lowercase. 💡 Tip: If 
 needed split() and join() built-in method can be useful here!   -- Rem
 ember that material not covered in class cannot be used\, thus\, the strin
 g methods capitalize()\, lower()\, upper() and others related to letters c
 annot be used here! Refer to the hands-on lecture videos for a baseline fo
 r treating each characater.\n\nExample:\n\n>>> title_case('we Are peNN sta
 te')\n'We Are Penn State'\n\nProblem 2. Dot product (10 pts) The dot produ
 ct of two lists is the sum of the products of the corresponding terms. Wr
 ite the Python code to implement the function dot_product(lst1\, lst2) w
 here both parameters are non-empty lists of numbers. The function returns
  the dot product of those lists. If the lists are not equal length\, ign
 ore the extra elements in the longer list. Your functions should not mutat
 e the provided lists. You cannot use lists built-in methods from the stand
 ard library (including min and max)\, only the len function.\n\nExamples:\
 n\n>>> dot_product([1\,2\,3]\, [4\,5\,6])\n32\n>>> dot_product([1\,2\,3]\,
  [4\,5\,6\,7\,8]) \n32\n>>> dot_product([5\,8\,7\,8]\, [4\,5\,6\,7\,8]) 
 \n158\n\n \n\nProblem 3. All about the balance (10 pts)\n\nWrite the func
 tion is_balanced(a_str) that takes a non-empty string of characaters\, 
 a_str\, as input. The function returns True if a_str has balanced parent
 heses\, False otherwise (ignoring all non-parentheses in a_str).  We wil
 l define parentheses as balanced when each right parenthesis closes an ope
 n left parenthesis\, and no left parentheses are left unclosed  at the en
 d of a_str. You cannot use any built-in counting methods or modules from 
 the standard library.\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> is_balanced("( ( ( ) ( 7) ) ( ) 
 )")\nTrue\n>>> is_balanced("( ) )")\nFalse\n>>> is_balanced("(())(())())("
 )\nFalse\n>>> is_balanced("())(")         \nFalse\n>>> is_balanced("(
 ((())))()") \nTrue\n\n \n\nProblem 4. Close to me (10 pts)\n\nWrite the 
 function almost_there(lst\, n) that takes a list of numbers and a non-nega
 tive integer. It returns how many of the elements of lst are within n o
 f their index. In other words\, the absolute value of the difference betwe
 en the element and its index is less than or equal to n. Remember that lis
 t is "zero-indexed"\; the index of the first element is 0.\n\nExamples:\n\
 n>>> almost_there([6\, 2\, 4\, 3\, 5]\, 1)  # 2\, 3\, and 5 are within 1 
 of their index\n3\n>>> almost_there([6\, 2\, 4\, 3\, 5]\, 2)   # 2\, 4\, 
 3\, and 5 are within 2 of their index\n4\n\n \n\n🔥 Problem 5. Close to
  me (20 pts)\n\nWrite the function move_to_back(lst\, values) that takes
  two lists\, lst and values\, as input. The function mutates lst so t
 hat each element of lst that appears in values moves to the end of ls
 t in the order that they appear in values. The rest of the elements in 
 lst should still be present in lst\, in the same order they were origina
 lly. The function does not return any values (except for the default None 
 value returned by Python). Remember that the only methods allowed for list
 s are append\, del and pop.\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> my_lst = [2\, 3\, 3\, 4\, 
 1\, 5]\n>>> move_to_back(my_lst\, [3])                \n>>> my_lst
                     \n[2\, 4\, 1\, 5\, 3\, 3]\n>>> my_lst = [2\,
  3\, 3\, 4\, 1\, 5]\n>>> move_to_back(my_lst\, [2\, 3])            
  \n>>> my_lst\n[4\, 1\, 5\, 2\, 3\, 3]\n>>> my_lst = [2\, 3\, 3\, 4\, 1\,
  5]\n>>> move_to_back(my_lst\, [3\, 2])\n>>> my_lst\n[4\, 1\, 5\, 3\, 3\,

DESCRIPTION:Students must submit 10 out of 12 possible weekly portfolio e
 ntries by the end of the semester. These are due weekly. If you do 11 entr
 ies\, your lowest score will be dropped.\n\nPortfolio Entry Specifics:\n\n
 * For this week\, you may want to identify a passage or set of passages fr
 om the Gita to do a close reading of its meaning. If you do\, be sure to d
 raw on and put the verse in conversation with key points from our other re
 adings that help draw out central concepts\; that is\, do not rely solely 
 on your own personal interpretation. If you are not confident about a part
 icular passage\, choose a different one!\n\n* For this weekly entry\, stud
 ents should identify and elaborate on:\n\n* 1-2 important concepts discuss
 ed in the readings\n\n* Bhagavad-gita\, all\n\n* 1-2 connections between t
 he week’s readings or\, increasingly\, between the week's readings and o
 ne or more readings from prior weeks.\n\n* You must make at least 3 distin
 ct points. These can (and likely will be) (inter)related. For example\, yo
 u could choose to focus on a prominent theme from the week\, such as dharm
 a\, and then explore that theme from three different angles and sets of ex
 amples. You can also identify topics that are not immediately related (but
  I encourage you to think harder about whether there might actually be som
 e interesting connections!).\n\n* Read this excellent\, succinct summary o
 f the "[6 pieces of a paragraph] (https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2339
 634/files/167902688?wrap=1)[ Download 6 pieces of a paragraph] (https://p
 su.instructure.com/courses/2339634/files/167902688/download)."\n\n* Studen
 ts are encouraged to prepare this critical analytical reading response in 
 a traditional 5-paragraph paper format\, but you can continue to prepare i
 t as three separate topics as well. Either way\, students must demonstrate
  her/his/their understanding of the subject and connect it to other concep
 ts\, theories\, or practices discussed elsewhere in the material. These d
 iscussions are intended to be analytical. If you include personal reflect
 ions\, it must be in service of a larger point you seek to make.\n\n* Reme
 mber: Think about what the aspects of Hinduism that you discuss can tell u
 s about the nature of Hinduism or the value that Hindus place on this 
 or that. For example\, what might a feature of a particular deity or myth 
 tell us about how Hindus conceptualize the nature of the divine or the rel
 ationship between humans and deities or how it all might inform how people
  live their lives on a daily basis or value as an ideal--and why?\n\n* You
 r entry/discussion must reference each of the week’s readings to earn fu
 ll credit. More specifically\, to earn full credit\, at least 2 of the 3 
 points must draw explicitly on (i.e.\, quote or paraphrase and cite) one o
 r more of the week’s readings in a meaningful way. That is\, to simpl
 y quote an author’s definition of a term\, for example\, is insufficient
 .\n\n* When citing your source\, please use the following format: (Author 
 last name\, page number) at the end of the sentence citing their work or i
 n a footnote. Example: (Baltutis\, 3). You do not need a bibliography or w
 orks cited page.\n\n* Minimum word count is 500 words. (Approximate 200 wo
 rds per point at minimum.) Maximum is 1000 words.\n\n* Include your name\
 , date\, our course info\, and portfolio # at the top of your submission.

DESCRIPTION:Read the instructions carefully before you start the assignment
 \, and ask the course staff for any clarification. Code that does not foll
 ow directions does not receive any credit.\n\nGeneral instructions:\n\n* T
 he work in this assignment must be your own original work and be completed
  alone. Academic integrity is expected from all students\, as a reminder\,
  academic dishonesty involves: \n\n* Searching online for solutions\n\n* 
 Copying code from a previous course or online solution (Except the code pr
 ovided by the course staff in this Canvas assignment)\n\n* Sharing code: b
 y retyping copying\, looking at\, or supplying a file\n\n* Coaching: verba
 l description of code from one person to another\, help a friend to write 
 code line by line\n\n* The instructor and course assistants are available 
 on Teams and with office hours to answer any questions you may have. \n\n
 * A few examples are provided to ensure basic functionality\, however\, th
 ey are no representative of the full range of test cases we will be checki
 ng. Further testing is your responsibility.\n\n* You may submit more than 
 once before the deadline\; only the latest submission will be graded.\n\n*
  Your submission must follow the class coding standards (a set of rules de
 signed to make your code clear and readable). The class coding standards c
 an be revised under Module 1 on the [📚 Coding Standards] (https://psu.i
 nstructure.com/courses/2344708/pages/coding-standards) page. \n\n* You ar
 e not allowed to use material that has not been covered in class. No credi
 t will be given if you use material that has not been presented in the cou

 ng git clone https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC131/ps4-<GitHub_username> \n\n* 
 You will be writing several functions\, but they will all be saved in one 
 file:  PS4.py.  Please save all the functions in this one file or you wi
 ll lose points.\n\n* Each question has different requirements\, read them 
 carefully and ask questions if you need clarification. \n\n* Commit and p
 ush your code to your repository as you make significant changes to your f
 ile\n\n* If you need to share your code with the course staff for question
 s and feedback\, send your GitHub username and the 7-character commit ID w
 e should check (typically the last one)  \n\n* 🚨 If you require an ex
 tension for this upcoming assignment\, remember to submit an extension req
 uest in accordance with our [extension policy] (https://psu.instructure.co

 \nGrading Notes:\n\n* Post-Due Date Testing (50%): When a function accepts
  arguments\, the valid data types and (if relevant) value ranges for these
  arguments are specified in the problem\, you may assume that all the inpu
 t you get will be of the correct type (e.g.\, if the input is a whole numb
 er\, we will test with integers). Some problems will also state what to do
  if an argument violates its value range (for example\, if an argument mus
 t fall between 0 and 1\, but 15 is used)\, if that information is provided
 \, your implementation must handle invalid inputs accordingly. \n\n* Desi
 gn and Clarity (50%): To evaluate code clarity and design that displays an
  understanding of class concepts we will use the following evaluation crit
 eria:\n\n* Code Readability (15%):\n\n* Includes information required in t
 he template file header (name\, GitHub username and collaboration statemen
 t)\n\n* Type annotations in each function definition (parameters and retur
 n type). \n\n* Docstring documenting each of the functions you write that
  includes a brief description of what the function does\, arguments\, disp
 layed information (if any)\, and return values. \n\n* Descriptive variabl
 e names according to our course standards \n\n* Example: Write a function
  named addition that takes two numbers\, adds them together\, and returns 
 the result as a float. Before returning the result the function must print
  a message reporting the result of the operation\n\n"""\n\nCourse: CMPSC13

 eturns/prints values with appropriate syntax\n\n \n\nGeneral Grading Rubr
 ic for All Programming Assignments\n\nPenalty\n\nReason\n\n-100%\n\nProgra
 m does not run due to syntax errors (missing colons\, indentation errors\,
  etc) or module errors (unsupported library imports) will not be graded at
  all\n\n-100%\n\nUsing concepts which you were specifically told not to us
 e\n\n-100%\n\nUse break or continue statements in loops when told not to u
 se them(while these statements are useful to provide multiple exit points 
 in loops\, they are highly abused when starting to program instead of defi
 ning a meaningful continuation condition. None of the problems in this cou
 rse involve complex exit points\, hence\, their use is prohibited in all c
 omponents of this course)\n\n-100%\n\nCode that uses content not covered i
 n class\n\n-100%\n\nFailing to submit the proper file.\n\nUp to -99%\n\nPr

  be given a grade.\n\nUp to -50%\n\nOutput of your program does not match 
 the expected output.\n\nUp to -70%\n\nProgram does not follow specificatio
 ns. The projects are designed to help you practice and learn various conce
 pts. When these concepts are not implemented as specified\, we cannot dete
 rmine if you know how to use these concepts.\n\nUp to -70%\n\nIncomplete o
 r inadequate comments/documentation. This includes using profanity in code
  comments or variable names\n\nUp to -50%\n\nUsing non-descriptive or non-
 professional identifiers. \n\nUp to -10%\n\nIncorrect code formatting. Wh

DESCRIPTION:Part One: Draft Submission (Due Wednesday)\n-------------------
 -----------------------\n\nSubmit a full draft of Assignment 3 by clicking
  "Reply" below and attaching your draft to a post in this discussion.\n\nP
 art Two: Peer Feedback (Due Sunday)\n------------------------------------\
 n\nAn important step in drafting is peer feedback. Pick two student peers
  who have posted a rough draft on this Peer Review workshop's discussion 
 board. (Scroll down below to find the discussion board. Try to select peer
 s who have not been peer reviewed already.) You will carefully read an
 d review each peer review partner's individual draft. Please respond to 
 both partners' essays by Sunday night.\n\nBe as specific as possible with 
 your comments and questions. For more information on how to peer review\,
  see [Commentary: What is Peer Review?] (https://psu.instructure.com/cours
 es/2357247/pages/commentary-what-is-peer-review)\n\nUse the following prom
 pts to guide your peer review:\n\n* Comment on the problem the writer has 
 chosen to address.  How well does the writer frame that problem? How does
  the problem offer an opportunity to respond?\n\n* Identify the writer's r
 hetorical audience.  Why might this audience care about the problem?\n\n*
  Indicate how well the writer shows how the problem will affect the reader
 .  What does the writer think the audience ought to do? How does the writ
 er establish ethos?\n\n* Comment on the writer's thesis statement\, which 
 should clearly state the proposed solution\, perhaps repeating the problem
  as well.  If you cannot locate a thesis statement\, what thesis statemen
 t might work for this document?\n\n* Analyze the research the writer has c
 onducted in order to provide support for the proposed solution\, in terms 
 of its feasibility\, cost and acceptability.  What additional evidence mi
 ght the writer provide to better support the solution's feasibility? How w
 ell does the writer establish logos?\n\n* Tell the writer if you think the
 y need to add more explanation of the sources.  Does the evidence feel as
  if it is dropped in with little or no explanation as to how it relates to
  this proposal?  What kinds of reasoning and/or evidence were left out by
  the writer that you think would help to make the argument stronger?\n\n* 
 Look carefully at those places in which the writer is referring to the ide
 as of a primary or secondary source. How well does the writer explain any 
 use of fieldwork or library/Internet research? If the writer uses a quotat
 ion or paraphrase\, is the source appropriately introduced in the text?\n\
 n* Comment on whether the writer adds their own explanation of the quotati
 on or paraphrase. If a writer only writes something like\, “This proves 
 my point\,” or “I don’t agree with X\,” or “I do agree with X\,
 ” then that writer hasn’t provided adequate context for readers to und
 erstand how the source material supports the writer’s argument.\n\n* Com
 ment on the proposed solution.   What steps are necessary for realizing 
 this solution? What does the solution ask of the audience?  Is the reques
 ted action explicit or merely implied? \n\n* Determine how well the write
 r connects with the audience in terms of aligning the proposed resolution 
 with their needs or expectations (establishing pathos).\n\n* Comment on th
 e conclusion.  What did you learn from the conclusion that you did not al
 ready know after reading the introduction and the body? What information d
 oes the writer want the audience to know? Does the writer attempt to chang
 e readers' attitudes\, actions\, or opinions?\n\n* Tell the writer which p
 art of the proposal you most enjoyed.  Why? \n\n

 nFor your initial post\, reflect on your habits as a writer. What are some
  of the writing practices that you currently use? How frequently do you wr

  do you space out your writing into small chunks? Identify one writing pra
 ctice that you would like to change or improve. Be specific.\n\nHere are s

DESCRIPTION:-----------------------------------------------\nPart One: Revi
 sing Assignment 3 (Due Wednesday)\n---------------------------------------
 --------\n\nFor this workshop\, you will work through the following short 
 readings and activities which will help you revise your Assignment 3.  Th
 en you will create your own personalized plan for revision and post it in 
 this forum.  Since you now have experience with revision in this course\,
  these readings and activities will guide you towards a more sophisticated
  view of revision.  They will also help you establish a personalized revi
 sion process that you can use for your future writing projects.\n\n-------
 ----------------\nReadings and Activities\n-----------------------\n\nRead
  the following content and work through the activities on your own draft.
   \n\nArgumentative Revisions\n-----------------------\n\nPeter Elbow\, 
 a professor of rhetoric and composition\, observes in his book Writing wi
 th Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process\, that "revising r
 equires wisdom judgment\, and maturity" and that "there is no way to get t
 hese qualities except through practice and experience" (121). \n\nElbow a
 rgues that trying to compose something that's good enough to submit after 
 only one draft is a "dangerous method" because it puts enormous pressure o
 n you to self-edit as you write and to "get it perfectly right" the first 
 time. In our course\, none of your final papers should be submitted after 
 only one draft. However\, unless you are aware\, it's easy for some of the
  issues in a first draft to remain unchanged in later drafts. Awareness of
  these issues comes\, as Elbow argues\, through practice and experience. W
 hile there are numerous issues to address through revision\, here we will 
 focus on three: unfocused organization\, rhetorical fallacies\, and plagia
 rism and patch-writing. \n\nUnfocused Organization\n---------------------
 -\n\nFor most writers\, the first draft is an "idea draft." In a first dra
 ft\, you are still working out what you actually want to say about a topic
 . It's common\, in a first draft\, for writers to discover what they want 
 include or discard only after writing their ideas down. Drafts like these 
 usually make more sense to the writer than to a reader\, as the reader doe
 sn't have the advantage of knowing your thought process. \n\n*\n\n* Activ
 ity: Stop and review the organization of your proposal and make sure that 
 your topic sentences and evidence are clearly outlined and logically conne
 cted. Be sure that any counterarguments are clearly marked and that reader
 s can easily distinguish when you reference outside sources. \n\nRhetoric
 al Fallacies\n--------------------\n\nFallacies are "argumentative moves t
 hat are flawed by their very nature or structure" (Lunsford 71). Because t
 hey appeal to our sense of reason\, emotion\, or authority\, rhetorical fa
 llacies can be pretty tricky to detect. If a reviewer isn't paying attenti
 on\, it's easy for some fallacies to get missed in a peer review or self-r
 evision. If you read your draft with fallacies in mind\, you're more likel
 y to catch these errors.\n\n*\n\n* Activity: Check each paragraph in your 
 proposal for any rhetorical fallacies (listed on pages 138-140 in The New 
 Harbrace Guide).\n\nPlagiarism and Patch-writing\n------------------------
 ----\n\nPlagiarism is defined as "the presentation of another person's wor
 k . . . without indicating that it came from a source" (Writing Matters 9
 7). Most students do not begin a writing project with an intention to plag
 iarize. However plagiarism can happen unintentionally (or intentionally) w
 hen writers are not careful with their documentation or engagement with so
 urces. More often\, plagiarism is the result of a writer facing enormous p
 ressure or anxiety as a result of time-constraints for a given assignment.
 \n\nPlagiarism\, as you should be aware\, is considered a serious issue at
  a university level and should be avoided at all costs. If you are tempted
  to plagiarize because you are feeling overwhelmed by an assignment\, reac
 h out to your instructor immediately. Working out a solution with your ins
 tructor to get you back on track is a much better solution than potentiall
 y facing the consequences of plagiarizing.\n\nRebecca Moore Howard\, a lea
 ding researcher on the causes of academic plagiarism in university-level w
 riting\, has also written extensively about another pervasive problem with
  source attribution and source engagement in student writing. This problem
  is known as patch-writing. Howard defines patch-writing as "copying and o
 nly partially changing the language of a source" other professional writin
 g organizations define patch-writing simply as the misuse of a source (Wri
 ting Matters 97). Based on her research\, Howard argues that patch-writin
 g is usually the result of not fully understanding or comprehending a sour
 ce\, poor documentation practices\, or a poor understanding of paraphrase.
 \n\n*\n\n* Activity: Read your proposal carefully\, checking for any place
  that you may have misused a source. Revise accordingly\, using the guidel
 ines for synthesizing sources described in Chapter 21 of The New Harbrace 
 Guide. \n\nPaying attention to these three issues can not only strengthen
  your writing\, but can protect you from the consequences of unethical or 
 irresponsible writing practices.\n\n-------------------------------\nYour 
 Personal Plan For Revision\n-------------------------------\n\nBased on th
 e feedback you've received over the course of the semester and your own in
 tuition\, create your own revision checklist and post it here.\n\nItems on
  the list should remind you of things that you need to look for every time
  you revise a paper. What goes on this list is up to you. A writer who str
 uggles with vague or unclear writing\, for example\, might include checkin
 g for pronoun reference agreement on her list. A writer who struggles with
  wordy phrasing\, might include checking her draft for places where she ca
 n combine sentences or reduce her word count by 15% before submitting the 
 final draft. You may also solicit your peers\, your instructor\, or frien
 ds for ideas about what should also be included on your list.\n\nWhile its
  natural to look to others for help determining what's not working with yo
 ur writing\, it's important to cultivate a sense of self-awareness about a
 spects of your writing that are consistently challenging for you. Most peo
 ple have an intuitive sense of when their writing is successful and when i
 t is not. The challenge\, then\, is trusting that internal guide and gaini
 ng the knowledge and skillsets to make changes in a revision. This is wher
 e Elbow's observation about experience and maturity comes in. Still\, ther
 e is action you can take now\, which will help you to become a better self
 -editor.\n\n \n\nWorks Referenced:\nElbow\, Peter. Writing with Power: Te
 chniques for Mastering the Writing Process. Oxford UP\, 1981.\nHoward\, Re

DESCRIPTION:---------------------------------------------------\nPart One: 
 Planning Your Infographic (Due Wednesday)\n-------------------------------
 --------------------\n\nPart one of this workshop has two activities. In t
 he first activity\, you will answer a series of questions about your audie
 nce and purpose. Although you are drawing information from a previous assi
 gnment\, your purpose and audience may be different for this assignment. T
 he second activity asks you to complete a wireframe sketch and design summ
 ary of the content and layout you have in mind for your infographic.\n\nAc
 tivity 1: Audience and Purpose \n---------------------------------\n\nWri
 te a post that answers the following questions:\n\n* Who will be the audie
 nce for your infographic? Why did you choose this audience?\n\n* What does
  your audience already know about your argument? What information do they 
 need to know?\n\n* What's in it for your audience? What will they get out 
 of being persuaded by your document?\n\n* What other messages seem to work
  on your audience? What rhetorical appeals can you borrow from other argum
 ents?\n\n* Where does your audience go to find information?\n\n* What are 
 the primary claims of your infographic?\n\n* What data or information do y
 ou plan to use in your infographic?  List their sources.  Be sure that i
 f you are quoting a source that you put that information in quotation mark
 s. You don't want to accidentally forget about copying the original source
  and later include that in your design. Unintentional plagiarism can and d
 oes happen this way\, so document your sources well even in your planning.
 \n\nActivity 2: Wireframe and Design Summary \n--------------------------
 ---------------\n\nIn this activity\, you will create and upload a wirefra
 me for your infographic.  You will also post a short design summary that 
 summarizes the content of your design. \n\nA wireframe is a visual guide 
 to the layout of a design\, that focuses on structure rather than the spec
 ific details. You might think about a wireframe as you would about an outl
 ine for a paper. In an outline\, you write down the main points of your ar
 gument in the order you plan to write about. Similarly\, a wireframe provi
 des a structural conceptualization of your design that makes it easy to en
 vision the basic logic and content of your argument. \n\nCreate a wirefra
 me for your infographic\, using basic shapes and labels to frame your desi
 gn. Label the shapes (e.g.\, image\, table\, text) so that your peers and 
 instructor can easily identify the different components of your design. Th
 e image below\, sponsored by Piktochart and designed by SeeMai Chow from N
 eoMam Studios\, depicts several examples of what a wireframe might look li
 ke. As you can see from this image\, the shapes used are simple\, but the 
 organizational outline of the design is still communicated.\n\nYou can des
 ign your wireframe using any tool or software you feel comfortable using\,
  including pencil and paper. There are specific programs to create wirefra
 mes\, which are also fine to use. Just don't overcomplicate this step. You
  may even want to include a few different layouts to see how your instruct
 or or peers react to different ways of organizing your research. Upload yo
 ur wireframe as a PDF file or provide a working link to a URL where your f
 ile can be viewed. \n\nIn addition to your wireframe\, include a brief pa
 ragraph(s) that summarizes the content of your design.\n\nNote: Although t
 hese layout designs are well thought-out\, don't assume that they are the 
 best or only way to communicate information.  You should focus on creatin
 g a design that is most suitable for your rhetorical purposes.\n\n[Piktoch
 art's Infographic Layout Cheat Sheet] (https://piktochart.com/wp-content/u

 arrangement/\n\n \n\n------------------------------------\nPart Two: Peer
  Feedback (Due Sunday)\n------------------------------------\n\nRead your 
 classmate's responses to the prompts and analyze the components of their w
 ireframe. Offer a peer review of their design so far\, critiquing anything
  that seems to need additional work.\n\nFor example\, you might notice tha
 t several of the sources or quotes that they included are biased.  You ca
 n give them suggestions of sources they could look at for a more balanced 
 perspective.\n\nGive them suggestions about content that you think would b
 e interesting to include as well as elements of design that should focus o
 n in the design. \n\n

 ednesday)</h2><p>Part one of this workshop has<strong> two activities</str
 ong>. In the first activity\, you will answer a series of questions about 
 your audience and purpose. Although you are drawing information from a pre
 vious assignment\, your purpose and audience may be different for this ass
 ignment. The second activity asks you to complete a wireframe sketch and d
 esign summary of the content and layout you have in mind for your infograp
 hic.</p><h3>Activity 1: Audience and Purpose&nbsp\;</h3><p>Write a post th
 at answers the following questions:</p><ul><li>Who will be the audience fo
 r your infographic? Why did you choose this audience?</li><li>What does yo
 ur audience already know about your argument? What information do they nee
 d to know?</li><li>What's in it for your audience? What will they get out 
 of being persuaded by your document?</li><li>What other messages seem to w
 ork on your audience? What rhetorical appeals can you borrow from other ar
 guments?</li><li>Where does your audience go to find information?</li><li>
 What are the primary claims of your infographic?</li><li>What data or info
 rmation do you plan to use in your infographic?&nbsp\; List their sources.
 &nbsp\; Be sure that if you are quoting a source that you put that informa
 tion in quotation marks. You don't want to accidentally forget about copyi
 ng the original source and later include that in your design. Unintentiona
 l plagiarism can and does happen this way\, so document your sources well 
 even in your planning.</li></ul><h3>Activity 2: Wireframe and Design Summa
 ry&nbsp\;</h3><p>In this activity\, you will create and upload a wireframe
  for your infographic.&nbsp\; You will also post a short design summary th
 at summarizes the content of your design.&nbsp\;</p><p>A wireframe is a vi
 sual guide to the layout of a design\, that focuses on structure rather th
 an the specific details. You might think about a wireframe as you would ab
 out an outline for a paper. In an outline\, you write down the main points
  of your argument in the order you plan to write about. Similarly\, a wire
 frame provides a structural conceptualization of your design that makes it
  easy to envision the basic logic and content of your argument.&nbsp\;</p>
 <p>Create a wireframe for your infographic\, using basic shapes and labels
  to frame your design. Label the shapes (e.g.\, image\, table\, text) so t
 hat your peers and instructor can easily identify the different components
  of your design. The image below\, sponsored by Piktochart and designed by
  SeeMai Chow from NeoMam Studios\, depicts several examples of what a wire
 frame might look like. As you can see from this image\, the shapes used ar
 e simple\, but the organizational outline of the design is still communica
 ted.</p><p>You can design your wireframe using any tool or software you fe
 el comfortable using\, including pencil and paper. There are specific prog
 rams to create wireframes\, which are also fine to use. Just don't overcom
 plicate this step. You may even want to include a few different layouts to
  see how your instructor or peers react to different ways of organizing yo
 ur research. <strong>Upload your wireframe as a PDF file or provide a work
 ing link to a URL where your file can be viewed.</strong>&nbsp\;</p><p>In 
 addition to your wireframe\, include a brief paragraph(s) that summarizes 
 the content of your design.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Although these la
 yout designs are well thought-out\, don't assume that they are the best or
  only way to communicate information.&nbsp\; You should focus on creating 
 a design that is most suitable for your rhetorical purposes.</p><p><img sr

 wo: Peer Feedback (Due Sunday)</h2><p>Read your classmate's responses to t
 he prompts and analyze the components of their wireframe. Offer a peer rev
 iew of their design so far\, critiquing anything that seems to need additi
 onal work.</p><p>For example\, you might notice that several of the source
 s or quotes that they included are biased.&nbsp\; You can give them sugges
 tions of sources they could look at for a more balanced perspective.</p><p
 >Give them suggestions about content that you think would be interesting t
 o include as well as elements of design that should focus on in the design

 art Two: Peer Feedback (Due Sunday)\n------------------------------------\
 n\nAn important step in drafting is peer feedback. Pick two student peers
  who have posted a rough draft on this Peer Review workshop's discussion 
 board. (Scroll down below to find the discussion board. Try to select peer
 s who have not been peer reviewed already.) You will carefully read an
 d review each peer review partner's individual draft. Please respond to 
 both partners' essays by Sunday night.\n\nBe as specific as possible with 
 your comments and questions. For more information on how to peer review\,
  see [Commentary: What is Peer Review?] (https://psu.instructure.com/cours
 es/2357247/pages/commentary-what-is-peer-review)\n\nUse the following prom
 pts to guide your peer review:\n\n* Give feedback on the purpose of this i
 nfographic.  Is it to inform? Persuade? Call readers to action?  Be sure
  to discuss specific areas of the infographic as you support your claim.\n
 \n* Read the design report draft carefully\, and create a list of key deta
 ils the designer provides about the audience and purpose of the infographi
 c. Then\, go back and review the draft of the infographic itself and provi
 de feedback on the following questions:\n\n* In what ways has the designer
  taken the intended audience’s background (their level of familiarity an
 d attitudes about the topic) into account when creating the infographic ? 
 In what ways could they improve in this regard?\n\n* Is the purpose of the
  infographic made clear to readers? How?\n\n* Given the designer's stated 
 purpose for this inforgraphic\, give feedback on the completeness and appr
 opriateness of the information provided. Are there any gaps in the content
 ? Give feedback on how well the designer anticipates readers’ questions 
 and needs. Also comment on the amount of wording included in the infograph
 ic so far—is it enough\, too much\, too little? Explain your answer.\n\n
 * Describe the tone of the infographic. (The design could be humorous\, ca
 lming\, startling\, energizing\, eerie\, etc.) How do the color and/or ima
 gery choices of the infographic complement\, contribute to\, or detract fr
 om this tone? What is one thing the designer can do to provide a more cons
 istent tone?\n\n* Give feedback on how well the designer uses principles o
 f visual design in the infographic. Each designer will need help seeing pl
 aces in the infographic where visual elements\, repetition\, or contrast a
 re not used as effectively as possible. Be sure to comment on the visual i
 nterest of the infographic—how is the infographic interesting\, or what 
 might the designer try to make the infographic more interesting?\n\n

  reflected on writing processes and practices. Together\, we have worked t
 o help you achieve a greater sense of confidence\, grace\, and sophisticat
 ion in your writing. I hope you will continue looking for ways to continue
  developing your thinking and writing. In so doing\, you will be making a 
 great contribution to the communities in which you participate.\n\nIn this

 a moment of insight or realization you've had about rhetoric. Did somebody
  give you a piece of peer feedback or say something in a discussion post t
 hat helped you become a better rhetor? Perhaps working on a specific assig
 nment made a "real life" piece of rhetoric "click" for you. In a well-craf
